=== AI-Generated TradingView Chart Analysis ===

Here's a table report analyzing the stock chart:

| **Aspect**          | **Analysis**                                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Directional Momentum** | The recent candlesticks indicate downward pressure following a peak, suggesting bearish sentiment.   |
| **Trends**          | The overall trend shows a recent reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend, marked by lower highs and lows. |
| **Volatility**      | Increased size in recent candlesticks and volume spikes suggest heightened volatility.            |
| **Support & Resistance** | Potential resistance near recent high around 612 and support around the current price of 594.            |
| **Volume**          | Current volume at 43.29M, slightly below the 30-day average (44.66M), indicates moderate activity.   |
| **Perceived Sentiment** | Neutral to Bearish. Short-term bearish due to recent declines, while neutral in the broader context. |

### Insights

- **Price Action**: The recent drop suggests potential continuation of the downtrend unless a reversal pattern appears.
- **Watch Levels**: Observe support around 592-594; if broken, further declines may occur. Resistance around 600-604 may cap short-term gains.
- **Volatility Expectation**: Stay aware of possible volatility spikes given the elevated price swings and volume activity. 

Overall, the perceived sentiment leans slightly bearish, reflecting recent sell-offs, although the sentiment may revert with strong support or positive catalysts.
