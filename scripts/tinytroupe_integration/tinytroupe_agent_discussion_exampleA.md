### Trends:
- **Upward Trend:** The chart shows a general upward trend from early July to late October, with higher highs and higher lows suggesting a bullish market sentiment.
- **Recent Highs:** The price recently reached new highs, slightly above the previous peaks, indicating continued buyer interest.

### Volatility:
- **Increased Volatility in October:** Notable long wicks, especially in October, suggest increased volatility. Large swings indicate strong trading activity and uncertainty.

### Price Action and Candle Analysis:
